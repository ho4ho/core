Enhancement: Regex version for blacklisted_files and excluded_directories

Adds two config options blacklisted_files_regex and excluded_directories_regex to enable more flexible
pattern matches. With this you can disable the upload of eg. exclude Microsoft Outlook .pst files or
creation of directories containg eg. <yourdate>_backup.
