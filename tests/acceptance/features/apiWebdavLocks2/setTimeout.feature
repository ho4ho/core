Feature: set timeouts of LOCKS

  Background:
    Given user "user0" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files

  Scenario Outline: do not set timeout on folder and check the default timeout
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    #And the administrator sets parameter "lock_timeout_default" of app "core" to "<default-timeout>"
    #And the administrator sets parameter "lock_timeout_max" of app "core" to "<max-timeout>"
    And parameter "lock_timeout_default" of app "core" has been set to "<default-timeout>"
    And parameter "lock_timeout_max" of app "core" has been set to "<max-timeout>"
    When user "user0" locks folder "PARENT" using the WebDAV API setting following properties
      | lockscope | exclusive |
    And user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "PARENT" using the WebDAV API
      | d:lockdiscovery |
    Then the value of the item "//d:timeout" in the response should match "<result>"
    When user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "PARENT/CHILD" using the WebDAV API
      | d:lockdiscovery |
    Then the value of the item "//d:timeout" in the response should match "<result>"
    When user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "PARENT/parent.txt" using the WebDAV API
      | d:lockdiscovery |
    Then the value of the item "//d:timeout" in the response should match "<result>"
    # consider a drift of 5 seconds between setting the lock and retrieving it
    Examples:
      | dav-path | default-timeout | max-timeout | result                    |
      | old      | 120             | 3600        | /Second-(120\|11[5-9])$/   |
      | old      | 99999           | 3600        | /Second-(3600\|359[5-9])$/ |
      | new      | 120             | 3600        | /Second-(120\|11[5-9])$/   |
      | new      | 99999           | 3600        | /Second-(3600\|359[5-9])$/ |

  Scenario Outline: set timeout on folder
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    When user "user0" locks folder "PARENT" using the WebDAV API setting following properties
      | lockscope | shared    |
      | timeout   | <timeout> |
    And user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "PARENT" using the WebDAV API
      | d:lockdiscovery |
    Then the value of the item "//d:timeout" in the response should match "<result>"
    When user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "PARENT/CHILD" using the WebDAV API
      | d:lockdiscovery |
    Then the value of the item "//d:timeout" in the response should match "<result>"
    When user "user0" gets the following properties of folder "PARENT/parent.txt" using the WebDAV API
      | d:lockdiscovery |
    Then the value of the item "//d:timeout" in the response should match "<result>"
    Examples:
      | dav-path | timeout         | result          |
      | old      | second-999      | /Second-\d{3}$/ |
      | old      | second-99999999 | /Second-\d{5}$/ |

      | old      | second--1       | /Second-\d{5}$/ |
      | old      | second-0        | /Second-\d{4}$/ |
      | new      | second-999      | /Second-\d{3}$/ |

      | new      | second-0        | /Second-\d{4}$/ |
